## Bolognese

INGREDIENTS

- `2 tbsp olive oil`
- `6 rashers of streaky 'pancetta' bacon, chopped`
- `2 large onions, chopped`
- `3 garlic cloves, crushed`
- `2 carrots, chopped`
- `Stick of celery`
- `1kg lean minced beef`
- `2 large glasses of red wine`
- `2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes`
- `2 fresh or dried bay leaves salt and freshly ground black pepper`
- `800g-1kg dried tagliatelle`
- `freshly grated parmesan cheese, to serve`


* Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan and fry the bacon until golden over a medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, frying until softened. Increase the heat and add the minced beef. Fry it until it has browned. Pour in the wine and boil until it has reduced in volume by about a third. Reduce the temperature and stir in the tomatoes and celery.

* Cover with a lid and simmer over a gentle heat for 1-1Â½ hours until it's rich and thickened, stirring occasionally.

* Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water. Drain and divide between plates. Sprinkle a little parmesan over the pasta before adding a good ladleful of the sauce. Finish with a further scattering of cheese and a twist of black pepper.
